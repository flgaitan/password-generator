# password-generator
In this project we are creating a password generator 

## Description

The motivation for the project was to meet user criteria to the best of my understanding of the topics covered and achieve the desired criteria.
- I built this project to provide greater security to the user. Another reason for this project is to figure out how JavaScript works within the context of the page's contents. 
- This project aids to provide greater security within a webpage, allowing the user to have a strong password generated for them.
- This project cannot teach me enough. I particularly had a hard time figuring out how to implement what I have learned. I tried my best to gather as much information and look at different examples to make my content work for me. I think the part that was hardest for me was understanding why my variables were being read as booleans and so trying to figure out how to give them the value intended, along with tying these values together to work in the big function was my biggest challenge. Hopefully I accomplished most of what I needed to. I think this serves as a great lesson and I will continue to dive deep into this subjects to become more familiriazed with the concepts covered and the way methods and functions work or how I can make them work for me and implement them for any desired project I am presented with.
